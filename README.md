# Tree Token
## ERC 20 currency and Minting Dapp



Builds a application around an ERC-20 token: **/contracts/treeToken.sol** 

**App.js** and **Main.js** compose the frontend, allowing a user to mint a $TREE once every 5800 blocks and also offers stats such as balance, total supply, and time until they can mint their next token:
